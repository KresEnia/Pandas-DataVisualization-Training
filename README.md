# Pandas-DataVisualization-Training

This repository contains my practice work in data analysis and visualization using Python libraries such as pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly.
The goal of this project was to reinforce and extend the material I learned in the Udemy course:
Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp

🔗 https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/

To apply these skills beyond the course, I selected two independent real-world datasets and explored them through a variety of plots and visualization techniques.

🧪 Datasets Used

I used two open-access datasets from reputable sources to practice different types of visualizations.

1. Hepatitis C Dataset (Kaggle)
🔗 https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/hepatitis-c-dataset
This dataset contains laboratory values and diagnostic categories for liver disease progression (Blood Donor → Hepatitis → Fibrosis → Cirrhosis).

2. Gallstone Disease Dataset (UCI)
🔗 https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/1150/gallstone-1
This dataset includes clinical and demographic features of patients with and without gallstones.
